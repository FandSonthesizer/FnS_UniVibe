# FnS_UniVibe

This is our version of the famous UniVibe guitar effect module. We modified the schematic in such a way, that the module fits into a synth rack to provide another flavor to your synth. The original version works with LDR (Light depending resistors) and a small light bulb. We got rid of the bulb and use a white LED instead. To drive that, we had to modify the lamp driver section. As LDR's we we lucky and got some vintage 80's LDR03's. But the design is so robust, that likely any LDR will work for you. 

The sound of this module is just awsome, make sure to check out youtube video. A guitar pedal version will follow later.
